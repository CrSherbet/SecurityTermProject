This project is about broken access control in OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks - 2017

Broken access control is a threat that is easily exploitable and widespread, as many websites allow 
unauthorized users to access areas of the site with a simple cut and paste into the browser. 
In addition to viewing unauthorized content, an attacker might be able to change or delete content, 
perform unauthorized functions, or even take over site administration.
